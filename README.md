# Nested Cross-Validation Project

This project is based on the paper [Cross-validation: what does it estimate and how well does it do it?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00673). We implemented Cross-Validation (CV) intervals and Nested CV intervals for Linear Regression. Additionally, we extended the implementation with early stopping to reduce the number of fit computations.

## Features

- **CV Intervals** for Linear Regression
- **Nested CV Intervals** for Linear Regression
- **Early Stopping** to optimize computational efficiency

## Experiments

Experiments demonstrating these features can be found in the [early_stopping_experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/Ohadeinav/nested_cv_project/blob/SUBMIT_BRANCH/early_stopping_experiments.ipynb) notebook.


## Usage

Run the experiments notebook to see the implementation and results:
- Open `early_stopping_experiments.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
